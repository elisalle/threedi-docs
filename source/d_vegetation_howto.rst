Vegetation
==========

When is it relevant to include vegetation in your schematisation?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. TODO: @Nici can we provide some general guidance about this to users? Can we give some examples of model objectives for which modelling vegetation correctly is crucial/helpful?

Choosing the right method for schematising vegetation
-----------------------------------------------------

- Very short vegetation: choosing the right friction values will suffice

- Very dense vegetation, such as the lowest bits of a mangrove forest or very dense reeds: if the vegetation is very dense, the vegetation can be regarded as a porous medium. This type of flow can be described by Darcy's law. In 3Di this can be implemented by using *interflow*.

- Medium or low density vegetation: use vegetation drag

Vegetation drag parameter values for vegetation types
-----------------------------------------------------

.. TODO: @Nici where can users find typical values of stem diameter, stem density, or drag coefficients for different types of vegetation?

Vegetation type and height data
-------------------------------

.. TODO: @Nici where can users find data on vegetation type and vegetation height? Even if we have only some example datasets we can point to this would be helpful

Calibration of flow with vegetation drag
----------------------------------------

.. TODO: @Nici can we provide some basic guidance on this specific to modelling with vegetation drag?
