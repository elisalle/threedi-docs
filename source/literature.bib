   abstract = {The presence of vegetation modifies flow and sediment transport in alluvial channels and hence the morphological evolution of river systems. Plants increase the local roughness, modify flow patterns and provide additional drag, decreasing the bed-shear stress and enhancing local sediment deposition. For this, it is important to take into account the presence of vegetation in morphodynamic modelling. Models describing the effects of vegetation on water flow and sediment transport already exist, but comparative analyses and validations on extensive datasets are still lacking. In order to provide practical information for modelling purposes, we analysed the performance of a large number of models on flow resistance, vegetation drag, vertical velocity profiles and bed-shear stresses in vegetated channels. Their assessments and applicability ranges are derived by comparing their predictions with measured values from a large dataset for different types of submerged and emergent vegetation gathered from the literature. The work includes assessing the performance of the sediment transport capacity formulae of Engelund and Hansen and van Rijn in the case of vegetated beds, as well as the value of the drag coefficient to be used for different types of vegetation and hydraulic conditions. The results provide a unique comparative overview of existing models for the assessment of the effects of vegetation on morphodynamics, highlighting their performances and applicability ranges.},

   abstract = {This study presents a finite volume hydrodynamic model for shallow water flow that computes on a coarse grid, but accounts for high-resolution bathymetry and roughness variations on a subgrid. The detailed information can be incorporated by using the assumption of a uniform flow direction and a uniform friction slope within a part of a coarse-grid cell. It is shown in two examples that the results of coarse-grid simulations become as good as high-resolution results, but at much lower computational cost. © 2013. American Geophysical Union.
