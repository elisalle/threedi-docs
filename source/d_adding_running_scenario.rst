Adding scenario information and running a simulation
========================================================


Before you can simulate your model you need to add scenario information. 
*A scenario holds information like the weather condition during a simulation, the total runtime of a simulation and laterals, breaches and initial conditions.* 
For a general guide see :ref:`scenario_information`.

Adding scenario information and running a simulation can be done in the Modeler Interface with the 3Di API Client or on the 3Di live site. 
The live site will provide an insight while the scenario is running, when your simulation is finished you can download the results. The API Client will only provide the results when the simulation is done. The API Client does provide a more detailed overview where you can enter your scenario information.
