What is 3Di Management
======================
`3Di Management <https://management.3di.live/>`_ serves as a centralized hub for uploaded schematisations, revision details, 3Di models, and simulations. This platform facilitates smooth collaboration, allowing colleagues to sync their models across laptops. This empowers users to work with the latest versions, enhancing version control for schematisations. This web-based portal is designed to provide users with the tools and information needed to perform day-to-day tasks efficiently.


Functionality of 3Di Management
-------------------------------
With 3Di Management, users can:

* Organize and oversee schematisations.
* Oversight 3Di models.
* Monitor and generate personal API keys.
* Keep track of users and roles.
* Monitor simulations in real-time as they run.
* Download simulation results.
* Manage a repository of simulation templates.
* Initiation of simulations through simulation templates.

A more enhanced use of 3Di Management is described in :ref:`management_screens_manual`. 


Uploading to 3Di Management
---------------------------
When using the :ref:`Modeller Interface <mi_what_is>`, schematisations are stored locally on your computer. If you employ the :ref:`models_simulation_plugin` to upload a schematisation, it will be stored in our private cloud and transformed into a 3Di model. Subsequently, both the schematisation and the model will be accessible via 3Di Management.
