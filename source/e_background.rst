Background
============

The 3Di engine is based on state-of-the-art numerical schemes. The engine makes use of a so-called subgrid method. This technique includes high resolution information in coarse resolution computations. This guarantees both accuracy and efficiency. The 3Di engine includes a whole range of processes, including surface run-off, 1D and 2D surface water and groundwater flow. Moreover, it can deal with 1D sewer flow and structures like pumps, weirs and culverts. 3Di deals with numerous external forcings, like precipitation from radar images and wind. These unique characteristics makes 3Di suitable for climate impact studies, flood studies and hydraulic design of open channel and sewer networks.

The 3Di engine is developed by Prof. dr. ir. G. S. Stelling, who worked on the subgrid technique in close collaboration with Prof. dr. ir. V. Casulli. Most of the techniques used within the 3Di engine are published in scientific papers.
