January 31st 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Januari 31st we have released the backend for the Klondike release. In this release we introduce a brand new route to process schematisations into 3Di models. This will replace the process known as 'inpy'. 
For users that have not been migrated yet, this will not have effect on their work process. 3Di Models will simulate as before. 

The migration will be rolled out gradually, users will be contacted for this. The management screens are available for all users right away, but keep in mind that the new features mostly work on migrated schematisations and 3Di Models. 
Contact our servicedesk if you have any questions regarding migration. 

We use the following definitions:

- Simulation templates
- Schematisations

3Di Modeller Interface 
----------------------

June 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*3Di Schematisation Editor v1.1 - EXPERIMENTAL*


This is a new plugin that will make editing schematisations much easier than before. 

What does this plugin have to offer for modellers?

- Directly edit all layers of your schematisation, using all native QGIS functionality for editing vector features
- Quickly add features to your schematision with the "magic" editing functionality for 1D layers. For example: existing connection nodes are used when drawing a pipe between them, new connection nodes and manholes are created when a new pipe is digitized, etc.
- Easily move nodes and all connected lines using the smartly pre-configured snapping and topological editing settings
- Easily move the start or end of pipes, channels, culverts, orifices, weirs, pumps, and the connection node id's will be automatically updated for you
- Get a complete overview of your schematistion: all rasters that are part of your schematisation are added to the QGIS project when the schematisation is loaded
- Spot the tiniest local variation in elevation with the hillshade layer is automatically added on top of your DEM
- Visualise the mapping of (impervious) surfaces to connection nodes and change them by updating the geometries
- Easily navigate through your schematisation: layers in the layer panel are neatly grouped together in collapsed groups

Version 1.1 is 'experimental' plugin, because it is not yet fully integrated with the other components of the Modeller Interface. In practice, this mainly means that you will have to convert between the Spatialite and the Schematisation Editor's Geopackage format every time you start or finish editing your schematisation.

New in version 1.1 (for those users who already tried out version 1.0):

- Facilitate adding channels and cross section locations (also fixes the issue that sometimes it was not possible to fill in channel start or end node ids)
- Delete referencing features
- Release through plugins.3di.live as experimental plugin
- Rename to 3Di Schematisation Editor
- Set scale dependent visibility for manholes
- Fix export to spatialite in QGIS 3.22 (was fixed by adding a schema migration in threedi-modelchecker)
- Fix drawing of pipe trajectory over existing manholes
- Consistent handling of geomtry edits
- Check write permissions for Geopackage target location
- Support spatialite schema_version 206 + updated the popup message if schema is not up to date
- Remove field cross_section_code
- Remove table cross_section_definition
- Make all id fields autoincrement
- End all editing sessions when user clicks Save to Spatialite
- Rename column calculation_pnt_id of connected_point to calculation_point_id
- Pump capacity should be NULL by default
- Add geopackage database connection to QGIS list
- Refresh map canvas after removing 3Di model
- Correct list of calculation types in culvert attribute form
- Guarantee that layers are added to the correct group
- Add hillshade styled DEM
- Raster styling classes
- Hide 'fid' columns
- More intuitive validation color logic in attribute forms
- Make snapping work properly after saving/loading project
- Fix scale dependent visibility for manholes
- Rename plugin to 3Di Schematisation Editor
- Fix width and diameter labels for tabulated cross sections
- Compatibility with QGIS 3.22 / Spatialite v4.3
- Drop-downs are used in the attribute table for fields with a limited list of valid integer values (e.g. calculation type).

*3Di Toolbox v2.1*

- IMPORTANT: If you update to 3Di Toolbox v2.1, you also _must_ update the 3Di Models & Simulations plugin to version 3.1. Failing to do so may lead to unexpected behaviour of several tools.
- Fix several issues with 3Di Spatialites in QGIS 3.22. Until now, all 3Di Spatialites were built using Spatialite 3, which QGIS 3.22 no longer supports. Migrate Spatialite now tranfers all data to a Spatialite 4.3 file.
- Graph Tool and Water Balance Tool plots now render properly on second screens
- Bugfix for using the SideView tool for open water
- Water Balance Tool in/out labels near the x axis are now located correctly
- Graph Tool and Water Balance Tool plots: time units can be chosen as s / min / hrs.
- SideView Tool and Statistics Tool: Feedback is given to user when manhole surface level is not filled in.

*3Di Models & Simulations v3.1*

- Compatibility with migrating to the new Spatialite v4.3 file
- Support rainfall events from csv with more than 300 steps
- The "New schematisation" wizard now has the option to use an existing spatialite
- You will receive a warning when trying to upload a rainfall CSV with non-equidistant timesteps
- Errors from the 3Di API are reported more clearly
- You can now view all simulation results available for download, even when more than 50 are available



March 2022
^^^^^^^^^^^^

*3Di Models & Simulations v3.0.3*

- Show schematisation checker results in two separate, tidy list widgets: one for spatialite checks, one for raster checks (#229)
- Include 'info' and 'warning' level log messages in schematisation checker output (#286)
- Fix 'Revision is not valid' error when uploading new revision (#334)
- Fix 'Revision does not exist' error when uploading new revision (#344)
- On startup, check if any incompatible version of the python package threedi-api-client version is installed and attempt to upgrade to correct version (#348)
- Allow rain intensities < 1 mm/hr (#180, #347)

*3Di Customisations  v1.2*
 
-	Remove all user interface customisations, except red menu bar
-	Add "About 3Di modeller interface" dialog

*3Di Toolbox v1.33*

-	Processing tools have been added to check the Spatialite and Rasters. These processing algorithms add the check results as layers to your QGIS project, instead of in a separate shapefile, csv, or text file. You can access them through Processing > Toolbox > 3Di > Schematisation. In the future, these processing algorithms will replace the current checker tools available in the 'Commands' Toolbox.



February 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released threeditoolbox 1.31 and 3Di Models & simulations 3.0.2.
"3Di Models & simulations" is the new name for what was previously called "API client". 
Please note: If you continue to use the old route, you still need the previous version of the plugin as well. 

We have also released a new version of the Modeller Interface:
Download here the latest version: `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.7-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ 



August 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the Modeller Interface with the following:

- Update on the animation toolbar
- Added tooling for dry weather flow calculations
- Water depth maps for multiple timesteps 
- Bugfix Sideview Tool

Download here the latest version: `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.7-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ 

Also we have included a comprehensive table on our docs showing the current status of implementation of features of API v3: :ref:`simulate_api_qgis_overview`

*Important note for QGIS Users*

Please note that installing QGIS has been undergoing some changes, at the moment the OSGeo4W Network Installer is the recommended way to install QGIS. See https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html for more information. This change does not apply for users that use the Modeller Interface installer.


*Animation Toolbar update*

The styling of all animation layers has been improved. The value categories are no longer fixed but based on the value distribution in the entire simulation. In the 2D domain, the animation toolbar now visualizes cells instead of nodes. Furthermore, the option 'relative to timestep 0' was introduced. This allows you to switch between e.g. absolute water levels and water level relative to the start of your simulation.
 
Below are examples of a dike breach. Animation 1 is showing relative change in water level and discharge. The plot is done for every calculation cell and flow line. Animation 2 is the same situation as an absolute plot showing the water level per calculation cell and the discharge over the flow lines.
Some other improvements to the toolbar include:

-	More user feedback.
-	The animation layers are removed when the Animation Toolbar is deactivated.
-	The groundwater layers are only displayed when the simulation includes groundwater.

*Dry weather flow calculator*

In some cases it is required to add dry weather flow to a simulation. To enable this a processing tool has been added to convert dry weather flow as defined in the model spatialite (dry weather flow attribute of the impervious surface layer) to lateral discharge timeseries that can be used as in your simulations.
In our earlier API (v1), dry weather flow was read automatically from the spatialite and calculated according a standard distribution.
In the current API (v3), dry weather flow is added as lateral discharges to allow for more flexibility. E.g. in the distribution of dry weather flow over the day.

*Water depth maps for multiple timestep*

We have added the option to generate water depth/level maps for a range of timesteps. The output is a multiband geotiff, where each band contains the water depth map of one timestep.
 
The water depth processing algorithm also has various minor bugfixes and improvements:

-	Selecting DEM layer from project no longer gives an error.
-	Generating outputs for timestep 0 without moving the timestep slider no longer gives an error.
-	Improved readability of LCD display by adding days to the display.
-	Set LCD value to 00:00 when file is loaded.
-	More accurate description of what the tool does.


*Bugfix SideView tool*
 
The SideView tool no longer worked since QGIS 3.16.6. This has now been fixed


May 21st 2021 - 3Di API QGIS Client
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.7-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ and an update of our 3Di API QGIS Client to version 2.4.1. The following has been fixed:

- Users no longer get a throttling warning when trying to start a simulation. 
- Results download only shows results for the model that is selected in the panel.

The location of plugins has changed from https://plugins.lizard.net/plugins.xml to https://plugins.3di.live/plugins.xml

April 22nd 2021 - 3Di Toolbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.4-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ and the `ThreediToolbox 1.18 <https://plugins.lizard.net/ThreeDiToolbox.1.18.zip>`_ .
This is a fix for the error *"Couldn't load plugin 'ThreeDiToolbox' due to an error when calling its classFactory() method
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'alembic' "*

April 1st 2021 - 3Di Toolbox
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Due to some changes under the hood in QGIS 3.16 we have released a new version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.4-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ and the `ThreediToolbox 1.17 <https://plugins.lizard.net/ThreeDiToolbox.1.17.zip>`_ 

March 8th 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the latest version of the `Modeller Interface <https://docs.3di.live/modeller-interface-downloads/3DiModellerInterface-OSGeo4W-3.16.4-1-Setup-x86_64.exe>`_ , which at the time of writing uses QGIS 3.16.4. 
For QGIS users: upgrade the plugin using the plugin panel. In case this doesn't work, it is possible to install the plugins as zip file. The latest versions are `ThreediToolbox 1.16 <https://plugins.lizard.net/ThreeDiToolbox.1.16.1.zip>`_  and `Threedi-API-QGIS client is 2.4.0 <https://plugins.lizard.net/threedi_api_qgis_client.2.4.0.zip>`_. 


*Local calculation of water depth & water level maps*

It is possible to generate water depth maps for every time step with the newest version of the Modeller Interface. To generate these water depth maps, 3Di applies a special algorithm that combines the water level results with the information of the DEM. This algorithm creates visually appealing maps. The maps show the water level and water depth results on high resolution, these can be based on the interpolated and on the non-interpolated water level results.

A quick guide to generate water depth maps:

Processing ^^> Toolbox ^^> 3Di ^^> post-processed results ^^> water depth

Or check out our documentation: :ref:`waterdepthtool`


*Extended support for starting simulations using the Modeller Interface*

We have added the following support for starting simulations from the Modeller Interface:

- added support for wind. See our user manual: :ref:`simulate_api_qgis` or our technical documentation : :ref:`wind_effects`  for more information. 
- added option of tags. This can be used to tag a simulation with a project related tag. This way it is easier to organise simulations.
- added time-interpolation options for laterals 
- added the option for Netcdf upload for rain
- option to set base URL for the API (for use of 3Di in other countries)

The following bugs have been fixed:

- start time is now correctly used 
- search window for models is now case insensitive
- bug fix lateral file upload

*Bugfix in the ThreeDiToolbox*

- Fix import sufhyd coordinates swapped on newer gdal versions.


February 22nd 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- We now support QGIS 3.16 for our toolbox

Download the latest version of the :ref:`qgisplugin`

Please not that the Modeller Interface is not yet upgraded to QGIS 3.16, we will do so when the QGIS repo's are updated.

For QGIS users: upgrade the plugin using the plugin panel.


*3Di Modeller Interface styling improvements*

Based on your feedback we have improved the styling of the schematizations in the Modeller Interface. Not only that, we now have support for multiple stylings! Check out the video to see how it works.Â 

The improvements are:

- For weirs, orifices and culverts, the styling now indicates when flow in one or both directions is impossible (discharge coefficient - 0)
- Grid refinement styling now indicates the refinement level
- Multiple stylings are added next to the default. Switching to these stylings allows you to visualize flow direction, code, id, storage area, bank level, reference level, invert level, crest level, diameters and dimensions, min/max of timeseries, and pump capacity.Â How it works is explained in the docs: :ref:`multiplestyles`

*Schematization checker improvements*

We are constantly working on improving the 3Di experience. Based on user experience analysis we have added the following checks to the schematization checker:

- Add check ConnectionNodesDistance which ensure all connection_nodes have a minimum distance between each other.
- Set the geometry of the following tables as required: impervious_surface, obstacle, cross_section_location, connection_nodes, grid_refinement, surface, 2d_boundary_conditions and 2d_lateral.
- Add check for open cross-section when NumericalSettings. use_of_nested_newton is turned off.
- Add checks to ensure some of the fields in numerical settings are larger than 0.
- Add check to ensure an isolated pipe always has a storage area.
- Add check to see if a connection_node is connected to an artifact (pipe/channel/culvert/weir/pumpstation/orifice).

*Bugfixes in 3Di Modeller Interface*

- Fixed h5py error, it is now possible to use the 3Di toolbox on QGIS 3.10.12
- Fixed x-axis bug in the water balance tool

February 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**General**

- Reordering of nodes and lines: the order and ids of the calculation nodes and flowlines will be different.

- Reprojection of 1D objects: the EPSG database that is used when reprojecting spatialite geometries to the model projection was upgraded from version 7.9 to 10.041. Due to improvements in the projection definitions, this may result in effects due to geometries that are displaced relative to the DEM (and correspondingly the 2D grid), for example 1D-2D lines or grid refinements. Note that in all cases no correction grids (e.g. RDNAPTRANS) or date-dependent datum shifts (e.g. ETRS89 to WGS84) are applied. Versions corresponding to EPSG database 7.9: PROJ4 4.8.0, August 2011 Versions corresponding to EPSG database 10.041: PROJ4 8.2.1, Dec 2021


**Channels, pipes and culverts**

- 1D initial waterlevels on channels/pipes/culvert nodes are now (linearly) interpolated between connection nodes.

- The volume of an embedded channel/pipe/culvert (that is added to the 2D nodes in which they are embedded) now stems precisely from the part of the channel/pipe/culvert that is inside the 2D cell. Previously, this was not the case.

- If the direction of a channel/pipe/culvert geometry is reversed compared to the âconnection_node_startâ and âconnection_node_endâ, then this is now fixed automatically.

- The calculation type of culverts is not ignored anymore.

- For calculation nodes on channels with connected calculation type, the cross section will be used until the surface level of the DEM. This will give differences for channels with connected calculation type in case the cross section is below the surface level.


**Cross section definitions**

- A new âclosed rectangleâ (type 0) cross section definition is available. This definition requires both width and height.

- For tabulated cross section definitions, the input is validated more strictly. Previously, a wrong input (e.g. using a comma as separator between numbers) resulted in the table only receiving one value.


**2D initial waterlevels**

- The no data value in 2D initial waterlevels is now excluded while taking the min, max, or mean. This means that cells with partial data now receive a water level whereas in the old route they did not.


**Obstacles / Levees**

- The algorithm with which 2D flowlines are assigned to obstacles/levees is changed. Now, every flowline that intersects the obstacle/levee is assigned to it.

- Also levee/obstacle geometries can be drawn outside the DEM area, which was previously not possible. 


**2D boundary conditions**

- The constraints on 2D boundary conditions have become less strict. Every border cell can now get a boundary condition. It is required however that the border cells of a single boundary condition form one horizontal or vertical edge. The boundary condition does not need to be precisely at the cell edge anymore. Also it is not required anymore to adjust the DEM to precisely align to the border cells; if there is no DEM data at the outer cell edge, the DEM data will be extrapolated.


**Gridadmin / Results NetCDF**

- The gridadmin.h5 and results_3di.nc file now uses NaN (not-a-number) instead of -9999 for missing values in float columns. Integer type columns still have â9999 to denote âmissingâ.


January 31st 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/1d_water_level/file resource to refer to initial_waterlevels with dimension = 'one_d'. 
- A POST on simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/1d_water_level/predefined now also creates a simulations/{simulation_pk}/initial/file resource. The scheduler ignores the /predefined one if the /file resource exists.

January 31st 2022 (Klondike)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


This release contains a big change in 3Di model creation. The Grid and Table builder have been rewritten from the ground up. 

**Breaking changes**

- Previously, 3Di models were created from repositories in models.lizard.net, by inpy. The new 3Di models are created from schematisations in the 3Di API, by POSTing to the "create_threedimodel" API endpoint. Because of a new Grid generation. Node ids can differ from old versions of a threedimodel. 

**General**

- CRS transformation (reprojection): transformations from the native spatialite projection (WGS84) to the model projection is now done using the PROJ4 library version 8.2.0 instead of version 4.8. Expect slight changes in coordinates if you use CRS definitions that received updates in the past years (Dutch ârijksdriehoekâ, British national grid). 
- Quadtree creation (2D Cells) 
- The behavior around refinements is altered slightly. Grid cell sizes at edges can differ slightly. 

**Channels, pipes and culverts**

- The order of the coordinates in a channel or culvert linestring does not matter anymore. Previously, in case that the geometry was reversed (the first coordinate in the linestring coincides with the âconnection_node_endâ and vice versa), makegrid connected the âconnection_node_endâ to the wrong side of the channel. 
- 1D initial waterlevels on channels/pipes/culvert nodes are now (linearly) interpolated between connection nodes. 
- The volume of an embedded channel/pipe/culvert (that is added to the 2D nodes in which they are embedded) now stems precisely from the part of the channel/pipe/culvert that is inside the 2D cell. Previously, this was not the case. 

**Cross section definitions**

- A new âclosed rectangleâ (type 0) cross section definition is available. This definition requires both width and height. 
- For tabulated cross section definitions, the input is validated more strictly. Previously, a wrong input (e.g. using a comma as separator between numbers) resulted in the table only receiving one value. 

**Obstacles / Levees**

- The algorithm with which 2D flowlines are assigned to obstacles/levees is changed. Now, every flowline that intersects the obstacle/levee is assigned to it. 
- Also levee/obstacle geometries can be drawn outside the DEM area, which was previously not possible. 

**2D boundary conditions**

- The constraints on 2D boundary conditions have become less strict. It is required that the 2D boundary condition intersects a horizontal or vertical string of cells. If there is no DEM data at the outer cell edge, the DEM data will be extrapolated to compute the cross sectional area of the boundary flow line. 

**Gridadmin**

- The gridadmin file now uses NaN (not-a-number) instead of -9999 for missing values in float columns. Integer type columns still have â9999 to denote âmissingâ. 
- The following datasets were added for nodes: code, dmax, s1d, embedded_in, boundary_type, has_dem_averaged 
- A group "nodes_embeddedâ was added. 
- The following datasets were added for lines: s1d, ds1d, dpumax, flod, flou, cross1, cross2, cross_weight 
- The following values were removed from meta: ijmax, imax, jap1d, jmax, levnms, lgrmin, linall, lintot, n2dall, nodall, nodobc, nodtot. 
- The âpreparedâ attributes were removed. 
- The following datasets were removed from pumps: nodp1d, p1dtyp. The datasets code and upper_stop_level were added. 
- A group âcross_sectionsâ was added. 
- The following datasets were removed from breaches: llev, kcu, seq_ids. 
- The group âsurfaceâ was added if the model contains 0D (surfaces/impervious surfaces) 


October 18th 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have released a new version of the computational core.

- There is an improved version to compute flow through a breach. The new formula is 2D-grid-size independent and allows sensitivity studies to be conducted based on the discharge. In most cases, your discharge results will remain roughly the same. Also, the discharge becomes tunable, to offer an easy sensitivity option. It also allows you to get back your previous results.
 
Bugfixes:

- Fixed the computation of the breach width. Especially, the initial growth was underestimated in case the time to reach the maximum breach depth was large.
- Fixed a small bug in the raster edits. This fixed also the option to perform rsater edits in computational cells having only 4 subgrid cells.
- Fix for broad weir formulation for the critical conditions

March 8th 2021
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In short the following fixes are included in the calculation core:
- Fix for long crested weir; new routine that does not request an extra computational node. 
- Fix for short crested weir; Fix to determine super- from sub-critical regime. 
- Fix for weirs for negative subcritical flows 
- Fix for 1D coordinates in netcdf file: The z-coordinates of the boundary points, are now set correctly in the netcdf
- Fix for initial conditions in netcdf file: In case of 1D-2D models, some variables, like the wet-surface areas of a computational node, the wrong value was written in the results netcdf at the start of the simulation. 

Long crested weirs: The formulation of the long crested weir has been replaced by a new one. This new version is based on the law of Bernouilli instead of an alternative implementation of the advective terms for a regular 1D element. The flow over the weir is an accurate computation of the flow under ideal circumstances, but the new formulation does not require an extra computational node and has proven to be more stable under varying flow conditions.

Short crested weirs: Flow over a weir knows three different stages: sub-, supercritical and critical flow.  Under super-critical flow conditions, the formulation remains the same. We fixed the formulation under sub-critical flow conditions and in strong varying flow conditions.  The biggest change in discharge behaviour is expected for weirs that flow in negative direction. Moreover, the time dependency of the flow over the weir has been adjusted. This has no effect on stationary flow, but has a slightly improved stabilizing effect on the flow under changing flow conditions.
