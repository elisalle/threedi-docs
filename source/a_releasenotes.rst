Release notes
=============

The next 3Di releases are planned on the 23rd of April 2018 and on the 22nd of May 2018. Below you can find the corresponding release notes. 

Release 3Di – April 2018  
--------------------------
On Monday the 23th of April 2018 the latest version of 3Di will be released. The 3Di team worked mainly on improving the performance of computational times when using the API, and on implementing groundwater flow. Groundwater flow will be available to everyone from next month. In this release we have worked on:

 
Application Programming Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you want to run batches of scenario’s or set up operational scenario’s the best route is using the API. An explaination for using the API can be found in the manual
:https://docs.3di.lizard.net/en/stable/d_api.html

- The computational times are greatly improved with this Release. Times can be up to ten times as fast.

Note: 
The reduction in computational time does not occur for simulations, making use of wind and/or breaches. It is no longer possible to follow these API simulations via the Livesite. At the next release, user feedback for API simulations in the livesite will be improved. 

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are improvements concerning:

-	Computations using embedded channels

-	The stability of connection to the livesite to make it more robust.
 

On Monday the 23th of April 2018  the 3Di web interface will be unavailable between 8.00 AM and 10.00 AM (CEST). The next full release is planned on Tuesday May the 22nd  2018.
