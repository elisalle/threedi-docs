Infiltration
------------

Infiltration is water that disappears in the ground.

**Implementation details**

The modeler can choose between different options for infiltration. For option one the full surface area of the cell is used as infiltration surface when it rains. When it is dry, water can only infiltrate in  wet subgrid areas. Option 2 forces the model to use the full cell surface infiltratable area. The third option uses only the wet surface area as infiltratable surface area.
