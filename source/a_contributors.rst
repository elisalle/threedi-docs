Introduction
============

3Di is an integral calculation model for water safety and water management which can be used for 1D and 2D calculations. It is developed by a consortium consisting of members from Deltares, TU Delft and Nelen en Schuurmans. With 3Di it is possible to calculate faster and on a bigger level of detail than with other existing models, even for a large area. This makes the 3Di model also suitable for online applications. Because results can be viewd during during simulation one can see if the model diagram is correct. This makes it possible to work in a quick and efficient way.
 
With the 3Di modelling tool it is possible to calculate all hydrological processes integrated in one model. The basis of the model is a state-of-the-art numeric calculation scheme. This scheme makes it possible to create calculations with bigger cells which are based on detailed information of the smaller underlying grids. This approach is particularly suitable for surface runoff. The scheme is combined with elements that represent channel flow, structures and sewerage systems. The model can therefore be used for rainfall-runoff, flooding  and sewerage simulations. Meaning, it can be used for issues related to multilayer safety, risk of flooding and analysing regional and urban water systems.

This document will help the novice as well as the experienced 3Di user. For the beginner it contains background information and key points for creating a first model, while for the experienced user it will serve as a desk book.
