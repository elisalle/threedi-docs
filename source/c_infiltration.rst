Infiltration
============

**Technical description**

The infiltration is implicity added to the continuity equation. This meas that the infiltration discharge depends on the infiltration capacity and the water level at the new and the old time level:

.. math::
   :label: infiltration

   Q_inf = I * ( H^(k+1) / H^n )

in which, k is the indicie for the inner Newton iteration loop, n, is the timestep, Q_inf is the....

maximum infiltration

neerslag, verdamping, etc. vertical processes
