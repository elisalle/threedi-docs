Create a new schematisation
============================

A new :ref:`schematisation` can be created from the :ref:`models_simulation_panel`.

#. Open the :ref:`models_simulation_panel` (|modelsSimulations|).
#. In the *Schematisation* section, click *New* (|newschematisation|).
#. Choose a schematisation name (obligatory) and tags (optional).
#. If you have rights to more than one organisation, choose the organisation that is to own the new schematisation.
#. Click *Next*.
#. Fill in other settings, such as the projection and friction type and simulation time step.
#. Click *Create Schematisation*.

A :ref:`schematisation` has now been created on the server. The corresponding folder in your local 3Di working directory contains the spatialite and (if chosen) a DEM and/or friction raster. This data itself has not been uploaded yet. See :ref:`uploading_schematisation` for instructions to upload this data as a new :ref:`revision`.
