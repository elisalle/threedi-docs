Tutorial 1: Using 3Di Live
==========================

Introduction
------------

3Di Live is an intuitive online interface to run 3Di simulations. You can see the simulation results as it progresses, and interact with the simulation in many ways. 3Di Live can be used to quickly and interactively assess the behaviour of the water system and communicate with stakeholders effectively. Simple edits can also be performed in 3Di Live, such as shutting down a pump, digging a hole for extra storage, or placing a flood barrier to prevent further flooding. 


Learning objectives
-------------------
In this tutorial you will:

- Become familiar with the interface and possibilities of 3Di Live 

- Get a feeling for how to utilize 3Di Live in your everyday work

The tutorial helps you to explore 3Di Live and its possibilities. We invite you to explore and try out the options available in the user interface. The more you experiment with it, the more you will learn! 

Preparation
-----------

Before you get started:

* Make sure you have a 3Di account. Please contact the :ref:`servicedesk` if you need help with this.

* At least one 3Di model should be available for your organisation. If this is not the case, you do :ref:`tutorial2_2dflatmodel` first.

Loading a model
---------------

#) In the browser, go to 3di.live and log in.

#) Choose a model from the list, or, if you know the name of your model, type the name in the search bar to find it. There may be more than 1 :ref:`revision` available, numbered with #1, #2, etc. Usually, you will want to use the one with the highest revision number, which is the most recent version of that 3Di model.

#) Click *Start*. If multiple simulation templates are available for this 3Di model, choose one. See :ref:`simulation_and_simulation_templates` for more information.

Discovering the model
---------------------

On the left side of the screen, you find a toolbar. The tools here are used to inspect the model, add forcings (discharge, pump, rain, or wind), or edit the model during the simulation (editing the DEM or adding a flood barrier). The layers button at the bottom-left opens the *Map Layers* panel, where you can change the visualisation to your liking.
 
#)	Open the *Map Layers* panel

#)	Toggle the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to visible. Find out what the lowest elevation in the DEM is? Hint: Use line selection tool

#)	What is the size of the 2D computational cells in m:sup:`2`? Hint: Toggle ‘Model grid’ to visible and zoom in. Use the line selection tool to measure the length of the cells.

Starting the simulation
-----------------------

#) Click the *Rain tool*. In the *Rain* panel, set the settings to a *Constant* rain event with an *Intensity* of 40 mm/h and a *Duration* of 2 hours. 


#) Click *Create*. Below the rain event options, you will now see that your rain event has been added. If you made a mistake, you may still delete this rain event. This is only possible as long as the simulation is still paused.

#) Click the *Play* button to start the simulation. 

#) Zoom in to the areas that are starting to flood. 


H.	How can you see the water level at a given location?
………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
I.	What are your options to analyse the water depth on the streets?
………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
J.	How can you increase the discharge through a canal/ stream?
………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
K.	Change the computational speed from Capped speed to Real-time speed. What do you see?  Hint: Look in the upper right corner.
………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
Adding events
L.	Change the weather conditions (wind tool and rain tool). Analyse how this affects the water level on streams and on the streets.   
………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
DEM edits
M.	In the User menu  , click Restart simulation 
N.	Now edit the DEM and simulate how this affects the water depth on the streets and water level in canals. 
O.	Stop the session via the User menu   >  Quit simulation
