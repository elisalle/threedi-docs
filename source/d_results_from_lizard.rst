=================================

3Di users that have access to Lizard can view and playback stored scenarios. Depending on your contract and location you may be able to view estimates of damage caused by inundation or flooding (waterschadeschatter).

1. Store your result at the end of your simulation on 3Di.lizard.net

    A. Click you name and click ‘store results’
    B. Choose a name for your scenario (and remember it)
    C. Check basic process results for water depths in Lizard

7. Then click the small vizier on the selected layer. This will zoom your view to your model extent and the correct period in time in which your scenario was stored (see time frame at the bottom of your screen).

8. To playback your scenario click the play button. To pause click it again. You will notice that the image will sharpen as soon as you pause playback. You may also click on a point on the map to view a graph of the water depth at that location.

9. Raw results can be downloaded from the menu directly. To download a raster select the export button and select the result you would like. You must choose a spatial projection and resolution. All data within your current view is exported. When the export is ready for download you receive a message in your inbox.
