Aggregated output
=================

Results for a 3Di simulation are normally written in a results file called *results_3di.nc* (previously *subgrid_map.nc*). This file contains the flow information (Snap Shots) at different times in the simulation. The interval at which these flow information are written is defined by the user via the parameter *output_time_step*. 
Aggregated results from certain intervals during the simulation can be very useful. The aggregated resulst for instance are input for the water balance tool in QGIS. For this purpose an aggregated results file is available called *aggregate_ results_3di.nc* (previously *flow_aggregate.nc*). On each Mesh variable (s1, u1, etc.) described in the results section aggregation can be executed. The configuration for this aggregation file is available in the models spatialite and the table is called v2_aggregation_settings. The configuration with its options will be explained below. The layout of the table is:

Configuration options
---------------------

In the spatialite a table can be filled to configure variables and their aggregation methods to aquire the desired aggregation results. The possible flow variables and their specific inputs are described along with all the possible aggregation methods. Users can determine multiple aggregation options for each *flow_variable* as long as the *aggregation_method* is not used twice for the *same* flow_variable.

var_name
^^^^^^^^

A user-defined variable name to distinguish between aggregated configuration of variables for user administration only. This setting is mandatory.

flow_variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The different flow variable for which to determine aggregated results are. The flow variables for input to generate aggregated results are:

* waterlevel
* flow_velocity
* discharge
* volume
* pump_discharge
* wet_cross-section
* lateral_discharge
* wet_surface
* rain
* simple_infiltration
* leakage

aggregation_method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The different aggregation methods that can be used on a flow variable are:

* max: maximum value of variable in timestep (configurated interval)
* min: minimum value of variable in timestep (configurated interval)
* avg: average value of variable in timestep (configurated interval)
* cum: This is integration over time of variable [dt * variable]. For instance cumulative net volume across flowline in timestep (configurated interval)
* cum_positive: This is integration over time of variable in positive direction [dt * variable]. For instance cumulative volume across flowline in positive direction for timestep (configurated interval)
* cum_negative: This is integration over time of variable in negative direction [dt * variable]. For instance cumulative volume across flowline in negative direction for timestep (configurated interval)

timestep
^^^^^^^^

Timestep is the interval in seconds for writing and determining the aggregated flow results. An example is when the maximum waterlevel needs to be determined every 300 seconds. Every 300 seconds the maximum waterlevel in that interval is determined at the end of this interval.

aggregation_in_space
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This setting is not yet implemented and is therefore always *False*.

Output format in result file
----------------------------

The variable name of the aggregated flow results in the *aggregate_ results_3di.nc* are named based on the chosen flow variable and the chosen aggregation method:

The flow variable chosen in the flow_variable field is converted to the flow_variable naming of threedi concatenated with the aggregation method. This convention look like this:
<threedi_flow_variable>_<aggregation _method> 
Every aggregated results has itâ€™s own time variable in the aggregated result file at which the aggregated flow results were written. This variable will be named based on the following convention:
time_<aggregation_variable>

The translation between the input flow variable name and the format in the the output file is given in the table below:

* waterlevel - s1
* flow_velocity - u1
* discharge - q
* volume - vol
* pump_discharge - q_pump
* wet_cross-section - au
* lateral_discharge - q_lat
* wet_surface - su
* rain - rain
* simple_infiltration - infiltration_rate_simple
* leakage - leak

An example of the output name is::

  flow_variable: s1
  aggregation_method: max
  output_name: Mesh2D_s1_max and Mesh1D_s1_max
  time_name: time_s1_max
