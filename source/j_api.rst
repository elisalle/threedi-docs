3Di Models & Simulations API
============================

Our `REST API <https://api.3di.live/v3/>`_ allows scripts and software applications to interact with all online resources and services serves as communication between all interactions of users and forcings and the functionality of 3Di.
The API can be used if you want to connect your favorite tools (Jupyter Notebook, Matlab, Power BI etc.) or programming language to 3Di.
This gives you a lot of flexibility to your modelling applications and can save you lots of manual work and time. Some examples of applications of the API are:

- Batch simulations: run simulations with hundreds of different rain events.
- Automated test runs, results checks and adjustments to a model before running another simulation.
- Run 3Di in an operational system, such as a Flood Early Warning System.
- Use Jupyter Notebooks to run, download and analyze your 3Di simulations.
- Design your own control for weirs or other structures.

The Models & Simulations API has a separate `Documentation https://api.3di.live/v3.0/docs/`. 

An overview of the endpoints (and their documentation) can be found in the `Swagger page <https://api.3di.live/v3/swagger/>`.

Additional example scripts can be found in `here <https://github.com/threedi/scripts-nens/tree/master/Notebooks%203Di%20-%20API%20v3%20-%20VD>`.
