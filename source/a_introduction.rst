Introduction
============

3Di is a process-based, hydrodynamic model for flooding, drainage and other water management studies. It can be used for the computation of water flow in 1D and 2D. The software is developed by a consortium of Stelling Hydraulics, Deltares, TU Delft and Nelen & Schuurmans. With 3Di it is possible to make fast simulations while using a high level of detail. 3Di allows the user to interact with the model during a simulation. One can interactively influence the simulation by changing the rainfall, wind force and model components like cross-sections, breaches and pump capacities.
