Surface Flow
============

The flow computed by 3Di is based on the 2D and 1D depth-averaged shallow water equations. These equations are based on the conservation of momentum. 3Di considers the various processes; inertia, advection, pressure and friction for computing the horizontal flow. 

Currently, we are working on improving the documentation. This section will soon be improved.
