Flow
-----------

In 3Di four different flow domains are defined. These consist of :ref:`surface_flow`, :ref:`interflow`, :ref:`groundwater` and :ref:`onedee_flow`. The flow in these domains are computed based on mass conservation and conservation of momentum. There are slight differences in the computation of the flow per domain. These are explained in the sections below.
