Style guide
-----------
- Use British English
- If you make screenshots, make sure there are no real user names and real projects in the screenshots. Create them using a demo account or blur them.
- Headings use sentence case, i.e. starting with a capital letter, but other words not capitalized
- The following names are used for our user interfaces:
  - 3Di Live Site
  - 3Di Modeller Interface
  - 3Di Management
  - Scenario Archive
  
- Do not mix descriptive text ("Tool X can be used for purpose Y") and instructive text ("Click the icon in the upper right of the panel"). Put these in separate sentences or even separate paragraphs
- Use "Click *Play*" to indicate where a user should click. DO NOT USE: Click on *Play*, Click the play button, Click the PLAY button, Click the **PLAY** Button, Press Play, Press on Play, Press on the Play button, Select the play button, etc.
